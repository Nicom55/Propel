# Propel
Propel is an app that lets you cheer on your friends and your community, and receive support as you tackle your own goals.

New things I've learned by building this app:

- Nested resources and routes
- More about link_to and link_to_if
- User sign-in and sessions
- Password encryption with bcrypt
- Implementing Bootstrap
- Basic Testing Principles
